Backend / API

Next.js API route → handles file uploads

Hugging Face Inference API (free-tier) → does the heavy lifting:

Audio transcription → converts audio to text

Text summarization → produces bullet points / action items

FFmpeg (optional) → converts uploaded videos to audio so Hugging Face can process them

Workflow

User uploads MP3, WAV, or video (MP4/MOV)

If video → FFmpeg extracts audio

Audio sent to Hugging Face transcription model → get text transcript

Transcript sent to Hugging Face summarization model → get action items / bullets

Display transcript + summary in the frontend

 

Frontend: Next.js + React + Tailwind + FileUpload

Backend: Next.js API + Hugging Face models

Extras: FFmpeg for video → audio conversion
